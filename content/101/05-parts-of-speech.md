## Parts of speech

Some of you may have spotted that I introduced the word **󱥡 sona** twice, first as a verb 'to know', then as a modifier 'wise'. So which is it? And how do you know?

In reality, it can be either! If it follows a noun, it's a modifier. If **󱤧 li** introduces it as a verb, then it's a verb. It's all about word order in a sentence!

In fact, the same is true of *all words*: if something is a noun, verb, or modifier, it can become *any of the three*! Among the words we've already learned, let's look at some examples:

| Toki Pona word(s) | As a noun         | As a verb                       | As a modifier           |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|
| wawa              | strength, power   | to strengthen                   | powerful, amazing       |
| sona              | knowledge, wisdom | to know                         | knowledgeable, wise     |
| moku              | food              | to consume, to eat              |                         |
| lukin             | eye               | to see                          |                         |
| suli              | size              | to make bigger, to emphasize    | big, important          |
| pona              | goodness          | to make better, to improve      | good, pleasant          |
| ike              | badness          | to make worse      | bad, unpleasant          |
| soweli, waso, ... | animal, bird, ... | to turn into an animal, bird... | of an animal, bird, ... |

(I've left some fields blank, because they're not important to us today. But yes, moku and lukin, too, can be modifiers!)

Let's practice using these words as nouns, verbs, and modifiers:

| 󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina                     | Meaning                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 󱤮󱤧󱥔󱤉󱥡        | lukin li pona e sona.              | Eyes improve knowledge.                     |
| 󱤶󱤧󱥣󱤉󱥑        | moku li suli e pipi.               | Food makes the bugs grow bigger.            |
| 󱤶󱤧󱥵󱤉󱥢󱤨       | moku li wawa e soweli lili.        | Food strengthens the small animal.          |

## Word order matters!

Since any noun can be a modifier, and any modifier can be a noun, word order really matters! Notice how these two phrases mean different things:

| 󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina                     | Meaning                                     |
|--------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 󱥢󱥣      | soweli suli | big animal  |
| 󱥣󱥢      | suli soweli | the size of an animal  |
| 󱥢󱥣󱤧󱥡󱤉󱥣󱥢      | soweli suli li sona e suli soweli. | The big animal knows the size of an animal. |

## li and e matter, too!

Remember how li and e seemed a little unnecessary? Now that we know any meaningful word can be used anywhere, as a noun, verb, or modifier, we can finally see how important they are. Thanks to them, we can distinguish these three very different sentences:

| 󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina              | Meaning                                |
|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 󱥢󱥡           | soweli sona                 | wise animal                            |
| 󱥡󱥔           | sona pona                   | good knowledge; to know well           |
| 󱥔󱥴           | pona waso                   | goodness of the bird                   |
| 󱥢󱥡󱤧󱥔󱤉󱥴       | soweli sona li pona e waso. | The wise animal helps the bird.        |
| 󱥢󱤧󱥡󱥔󱤉󱥴       | soweli li sona pona e waso. | The animal knows the bird well.        |
| 󱥢󱤧󱥡󱤉󱥔󱥴       | soweli li sona e pona waso. | The animal knows how good the bird is. |

If you are ever confused about how to read or write a sentence, start by asking: "Where is the subject? Where is the verb? Where is the object?", and everything neatly separates into small phrases!
