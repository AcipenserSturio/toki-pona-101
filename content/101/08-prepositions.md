## Prepositions

Now that we know some countries, let's talk about travel! But how do you say "go to" and "come from"? For that, we will need some verbs and prepositions:

| 󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina | Meaning                             |
|-------------:|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 󱥶 | weka | absent, away; to remove, to go away |
| 󱥌 | pana | to give, to put                     |
| 󱤖 | kama | to come, to arrive                  |
| 󱤈 | awen | to stay, to remain                  |
| 󱥩 | tawa | to, towards |
| 󱤬 | lon  | at, on, in |
| 󱥧 | tan  | from, because of |

In Toki Pona, prepositions can be used one of two ways. Firstly, we can use prepositions at the end of a sentence:

| 󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina | Meaning                             |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 󱤴󱥌󱤉󱥴󱥩󱤗 | mi pana e waso tawa kasi.  | I put a bird onto a tree.          |
| 󱥴󱤧󱤈󱤬󱤗  | waso li awen lon kasi.     | The bird remains on a tree.        |
| 󱥞󱥶󱤉󱥴󱥧󱤗 | sina weka e waso tan kasi. | You remove the bird from the tree. |

But secondly, they can also fill the verb slot all by themselves:

| 󱥠󱥔                | sitelen Lasina            | Meaning                |
|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 󱤑󱦐󱤉󱤰󱤈󱦑󱤧󱥩󱤰󱦐󱥁󱤍󱤑󱥆󱥁󱦑  | jan Ema li tawa ma Nijon. | Emma goes to Japan.    |
| 󱤑󱦐󱥁󱤍󱥁󱤈󱦑󱤧󱤬󱤰󱦐󱤧󱥱󱥞󱤍󱦑  | jan Nina li lon ma Lusi.  | Nina is in Russia.     |
| 󱤑󱦐󱤴󱤍󱤧󱤍󱦑󱤧󱥧󱤰󱦐󱤗󱤂󱥁󱥞󱤉󱦑 | jan Mili li tan ma Kanse. | Millie is from France. |

Let's practice with these sentences:
| 󱥠󱥔                | sitelen Lasina            | Meaning                |
|---|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|   | mi tawa ma kasi.                | I go to the plant land. (perhaps the forest.)         |
|   | sona li weka tan mi.            | Knowledge went away from me. (I forgot.)              |
|   | soweli lili li pona tawa mi.    | Small animals are good to me. (I like small animals.) |
|   | jan Nowa li toki tawa Ema.      | Noah speaks to Emma.                                  |
|   | jan li toki Kanse lon ma Kanse. | People speak French in France.                        |
