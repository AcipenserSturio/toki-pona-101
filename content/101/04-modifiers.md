## Describe!

Now you know some nouns (things) and verbs (actions). Time to add adjectives (descriptions)!  
Let's memorise a few of them:

| sitelen pona | sitelen Lasina | Meaning             |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 󱥣            | suli           | large, important    |
| 󱤨            | lili           | small, young        |
| 󱥔            | pona           | good, pleasant      |
| 󱤍            | ike            | bad, unpleasant     |
| 󱥵            | wawa           | powerful, amazing   |
| 󱥡            | sona           | knowledgeable, wise |

In English, adjectives go before the noun: *good dog*, *wise bird*. But in Toki Pona, they always go after: *soweli pona*, *waso sona*. This is how it works in French, Irish, Arabic, Malay, and many other languages. Think of it this way: the first word is always the most important!

Let's make some sentences with descriptions:

| sitelen pona | sitelen Lasina                   | Meaning                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 󱥴󱤧󱤮󱤉󱥢󱤨       | waso li lukin e soweli lili.     | The bird sees a small animal.        |
| 󱥢󱥵󱤧󱤶󱤉󱤗󱥣      | soweli wawa li moku e kasi suli. | The strong animal eats large plants. |
| 󱥑󱤍󱤧󱤶󱤨󱤉󱥢      | pipi ike li moku lili e soweli.  | Mean bugs bite the animal a little.  |
| 󱥴󱥡󱤧󱥡󱥔󱤉󱥑      | waso sona li sona pona e pipi.   | The wise bird knows bugs well.       |

If these sentences feel long and tiresome, don't worry! We will look at some shorter sentences soon. Remember: the sentence structure is actually quite simple! You can always tell which part is the subject, the verb, and the object, by looking at **󱤧 li** and **󱤉 e**.

Here's something interesting: in English, adjectives only go on nouns. But in Toki Pona, they can go on verbs too, like English adverbs: *to bite a little* ~ *moku lili*, *to know well* ~ *sona pona*. For this reason, instead of "adjective" or "adverb", we will call them a more generic term: modifier!
