## Pronouns

You're probably tired of long sentences and parts-of-speech shenanigans. Let's take it down a notch, by pointing at things:

| sitelen pona | sitelen Lasina | Meaning             |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 󱥁            | ni             | this, that          |
| 󱥁󱤧󱥢          | ni li soweli.    | This is an animal.      |
| 󱥁󱤧󱤗          | ni li kasi.      | This is a plant.        |
| 󱥁󱤧󱤶󱥔         | ni li moku pona. | This is good food.      |
| 󱥁󱤧󱥣          | ni li suli.      | This is important.      |
| 󱥁󱤧󱥔 󱥵        | ni li pona wawa. | This is amazingly good. |

These are our first *sentences without an object*, and so there is no **e** in these sentences!

(You might wonder, shouldn't "an animal, a plant, important" and so on, be the object? And it makes sense in English! You see a noun, verb, noun. But in many languages, including Toki Pona, "to be" doesn't exist as its own word. Instead, **li** introduces a verb "to-be-blank". This can be **soweli** "to be an animal", **suli** "to be important" and so on.)

Now that we've looked at one pronoun, let's get some more:

| sitelen pona | sitelen Lasina |                 Meaning                 |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 󱤴            | mi             | I, we; my, our                          |
| 󱥞            | sina           | you; your                               |
| 󱥆            | ona            | she, he, it, they; her, his, its, their |

Let's practice using **󱤴 mi**, **󱥞 sina**, **󱥆 ona**, and **󱥁 ni** in sentences:

| sitelen pona |         sitelen Lasina         |           Meaning          |
|--------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| 󱤗󱥁󱤧󱥣         | kasi ni li suli.               | This plant is big.         |
| 󱥡󱥞󱤧󱥵         | sona sina li wawa.             | Your knowledge is amazing. |
| 󱥑󱥁󱤧󱥑󱤴        | pipi ni li pipi mi.            | This bug is my bug.        |
| 󱥴󱥞󱤧󱤮󱤉󱤴       | waso sina li lukin e mi.       | Your bird sees me.         |
| 󱥴󱤧󱤶󱤉󱥑󱥁       | waso li moku e pipi ni.        | The bird eats this bug.    |
| 󱥢󱤴󱤧󱤶󱤉󱤗󱥞      | soweli mi li moku e kasi ona.  | My animal eats its plant. |

They act like normal! But something strange happens when **󱤴 mi** or **󱥞 sina** is the subject of the sentence:

| sitelen pona |     sitelen Lasina     |           Meaning          |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| 󱤴󱥵           | mi wawa.               | I am strong.               |
| 󱥞󱤮󱤉󱤶         | sina lukin e moku.     | You see food.              |
| 󱤴󱥡󱤉󱤗󱥣        | mi sona e kasi suli.   | I know the big plant.      |
| 󱥞󱥡󱤉󱥣󱤗        | sina sona e suli kasi. | You know the plant's size. |

Toki Pona has a special rule: when **󱤴 mi** or **󱥞 sina** is the subject of the sentence, the **󱤧 li** that would normally follow them disappears. This is because sentences starting with **󱤴 mi** or **󱥞 sina** are extremely common!
