This explainer is a bit of a prototype. I have to make it better! Please ask other teachers for now.

Sometimes, you look at a Toki Pona sentence and its translation, and wonder what English word to match 'li' with. The word 'is' often looks promising:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="waso li pona." m="The bird *is* good." />
  <Sentence sl="waso li moku e pipi." m="The bird *is* eating a bug." />
</List>

In reality, 'is' only starts to exist when translated into English. Compare these translations:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="soweli li wile moku." m="The animal *is* hungry. = The animal wants to eat." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li pilin pona." m="The person *is* happy. = The person feels good." />
</List>

English inserts a dummy verb ‘to be’ if the translation would lack a main verb otherwise:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan li pilin pona." m="The person happy? ❌ The person happies? ❌ The person is happy. ✅" />
</List>

But 'li' is not special! This happens both with 'li' and with 'o':

<List>
  <Sentence sl="o pilin pona!" m="Happy! ❌ Be happy! ✅" />
</List>

Sentences with preverbs reveal that 'to be' actually belongs with the main verb, not with 'li'.:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="waso li ken pimeja." m="A bird can *be black*." />
</List>

Here you can see "pimeja" is the main verb of the sentence, so it means "to be black". Now 'be' not even in the same place as 'li'!
