## Prepositions

Now that we know some countries, let's talk about travel! But how do you say "go to" and "come from"? For that, we will need some verbs and prepositions:

|  󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina | Meaning                             |
| --: | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
|   󱥶 | weka           | absent, away; to remove, to go away |
|   󱥌 | pana           | to give, to put                     |
|   󱤖 | kama           | to come, to arrive                  |
|   󱤈 | awen           | to stay, to remain                  |
|   󱥩 | tawa           | to, towards                         |
|   󱤬 | lon            | at, on, in                          |
|   󱥧 | tan            | from, because of                    |

In Toki Pona, prepositions can be used one of two ways. Firstly, we can use prepositions at the end of a sentence:

<SentenceGrid>
  <Sentence
    sl="mi pana e waso tawa kasi."
    m="I put a bird onto a tree."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="waso li awen lon kasi."
    m="The bird remains on a tree."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="sina weka e waso tan kasi."
    m="You remove the bird from the tree."
  />
</SentenceGrid>

But secondly, they can also fill the verb slot all by themselves:

<SentenceGrid>
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Ema li tawa ma Nijon."
    m="Emma goes to Japan."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Nina li lon ma Lusi."
    m="Nina is in Russia."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Mili li tan ma Kanse."
    m="Millie is from France."
  />
</SentenceGrid>

Let's practice with these sentences:

<SentenceGrid>
  <Sentence
    sl="mi tawa ma kasi."
    m="I go to the plant land. (perhaps the forest.)"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="sona li weka tan mi."
    m="Knowledge went away from me. (I forgot.)"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="soweli lili li pona tawa mi."
    m="Small animals are good to me. (I like small animals.)"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Nowa li toki tawa Ema."
    m="Noah speaks to Emma."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan li toki Tosi lon ma Tosi."
    m="People speak German in Germany."
  />
</SentenceGrid>
