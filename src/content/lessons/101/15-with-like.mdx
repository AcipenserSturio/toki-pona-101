## With and like

In lesson 8, we learned three prepositions: **󱥩 tawa**, **󱤬 lon**, **󱥧 tan**, which are all about location and direction. Toki Pona actually has two more prepositions:

<List>
  <Word sl="kepeken" m="using, by means of" />
  <Word sl="sama" m="similar to, same as" />
</List>

Let's learn a few more words that go well with these prepositions:

<List>
  <Word sl="ante" m="to change; different, other" />
  <Word sl="pali" m="to work, to build" />
  <Word sl="leko" m="brick, block" />
</List>

Remember, prepositions start prepositional phrases:

<List>
  <Word sl="sama sina" m="same as you" />
  <Word sl="kepeken toki" m="by means of language" />
  <Word sl="kepeken ilo ante" m="with a different tool" />
</List>

And those phrases then go either on the end of a sentence:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi toki sama sina." m="I speak like you." />
  <Sentence sl="mi pali e leko kepeken ilo." m="I make bricks using a tool." />
</List>

Or in place of the verb itself:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi sama sina." m="I am like you." />
  <Sentence sl="mi kepeken ilo." m="I use a tool." />
</List>

## Moving a house

Now that you know all five prepositions: **󱥩 tawa**, **󱤬 lon**, **󱥧 tan**, **󱤙 kepeken**, and **󱥖 sama**, here's something new about them: these can all be regular nouns, verbs, or adjectives!

<List>
  <Word sl="tawa" m="to move; movement; moving" />
  <Word sl="lon" m="true, real, existing" />
  <Word sl="tan" m="cause, origin" />
  <Word sl="kepeken" m="usage" />
  <Word sl="sama" m="similar, alike" />
</List>

Some of them, like **󱥩 tawa**, **󱤬 lon**, are used this way very frequently. Others, like **󱥧 tan** and **󱤙 kepeken**, quite rarely. Let's look at some examples:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="sona mi li sama." m="My knowledge is similar." />
  <Sentence
    sl="toki sina li lon."
    m="Your speech is real.<br />(What you're saying is true.)"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="mi wile lukin e sitelen tawa."
    m="I want to watch a moving picture. (a video, a film)"
  />
</List>

Sometimes you can make very similar sentences, except one has a verb like **󱥩 tawa** or **󱤬 lon**, and the other has a preposition **󱥩 tawa** or **󱤬 lon**!
Make sure not to confuse these pairs:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi tawa tomo." m="I go to the house. (preposition)" />
  <Sentence sl="mi tawa e tomo." m="I move the house. (verb)" />
  <Sentence sl="mi lon ma." m="I'm on land. (preposition)" />
  <Sentence sl="mi lon e ma." m="I summon land into reality. (verb)" />
</List>
