## Requests

In Toki Pona, a sentence with **󱤧 li** is a statement of fact. But sometimes instead of making statements of fact, we want to make requests. Requests are how we tell other people what we want to happen. In a request, instead of **󱤧 li**, we use **󱥄 o**:

<List>
  <Word sl="o" m="starts a request, command, instruction, wish" />
  <Sentence sl="ilo li sitelen e pipi." m="The phone is showing a bug." />
  <Sentence sl="ilo o sitelen e waso!" m="Oh phone, please show a bird!" />
</List>

Let's let's look at a few more commands:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan o lukin e lipu pona!" m="People, please read the good paper!" />
  <Sentence sl="soweli mi o moku pona!" m="My cat, please eat well!" />
  <Sentence sl="jan lili sina o kama wawa!" m="May your child become strong!" />
  <Sentence sl="pona o tawa sina!" m="May goodness go to you! (Blessings be upon you!)" />
</List>

You might notice that some of these sentences separate quite nicely in two parts:
* The call for someone's attention (before **󱥄 o**)
* The request itself (after **󱥄 o**)

We can use those separately:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan Ema o pini e lupa tomo!" m="Emma, please close the door!" />
  <Sentence sl="jan Ema o!" m="Hey, Emma!" />
  <Sentence sl="o pini e lupa tomo!" m="Please close the door!" />
</List>
