## Parts of speech

Some of you may have spotted that I introduced the word **󱥡 sona** twice, first as a verb 'to know', then as a modifier 'wise'. So which is it? And how do you know?

In reality, it can be either! If it follows a noun, it's a modifier. If **󱤧 li** introduces it as a verb, then it's a verb. It's all about word order in a sentence!

In fact, the same is true of _all words_: if something is a noun, verb, or modifier, it can become _any of the three_! Among the words we've already learned, let's look at some examples:

| Toki Pona word(s) | As a noun         | As a verb                       | As a modifier           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| wawa              | strength, power   | to strengthen                   | powerful, amazing       |
| sona              | knowledge, wisdom | to know                         | knowledgeable, wise     |
| moku              | food              | to consume, to eat              |                         |
| lukin             | eye               | to see                          |                         |
| suli              | size              | to make bigger, to emphasize    | big, important          |
| pona              | goodness          | to make better, to improve      | good, pleasant          |
| ike               | badness           | to make worse                   | bad, unpleasant         |
| soweli, waso, ... | animal, bird, ... | to turn into an animal, bird... | of an animal, bird, ... |

(I've left some fields blank, because they're not important to us today. But yes, moku and lukin, too, can be modifiers!)

Let's practice using these words as nouns, verbs, and modifiers:

<Sentences>
  <Sentence sl="lukin li pona e sona." m="Eyes improve knowledge." />
  <Sentence sl="moku li suli e pipi." m="Food makes the bugs grow bigger." />
  <Sentence
    sl="moku li wawa e soweli lili."
    m="Food strengthens the small animal."
  />
</Sentences>

## Word order matters!

Since any noun can be a modifier, and any modifier can be a noun, word order really matters! Notice how these two phrases mean different things:

<Sentences>
  <Sentence sl="soweli suli" m="big animal" />
  <Sentence sl="suli soweli" m="the size of an animal" />
  <Sentence
    sl="soweli suli li sona e suli soweli."
    m="The big animal knows the size of an animal."
  />
</Sentences>

## li and e matter, too!

Remember how li and e seemed a little unnecessary? Now that we know any meaningful word can be used anywhere, as a noun, verb, or modifier, we can finally see how important they are. Thanks to them, we can distinguish these three very different sentences:

<Sentences>
  <Sentence sl="soweli sona" m="wise animal" />
  <Sentence sl="sona pona" m="good knowledge; to know well" />
  <Sentence sl="pona waso" m="goodness of the bird" />
  <Sentence
    sl="soweli sona li pona e waso."
    m="The wise animal helps the bird."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="soweli li sona pona e waso."
    m="The animal knows the bird well."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="soweli li sona e pona waso."
    m="The animal knows how good the bird is."
  />
</Sentences>
If you are ever confused about how to read or write a sentence, start by asking:
"Where is the subject? Where is the verb? Where is the object?", and everything
neatly separates into small phrases!
