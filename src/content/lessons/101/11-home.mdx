There's a lot of stuff in our homes:

<List>
  <Word sl="ilo" m="tool, like a hammer, fork, phone, app" />
  <Word sl="lipu" m="flat thing for ó±¥¡ sona, like paper, card, book, website" />
  <Word sl="poki" m="container, like a box, drawer, bottle" />

  <Word sl="lupa" m="an opening, like a door, window, hole" />
  <Word sl="len" m="a cover, like clothes, shoes, blanket" />
</List>

And here's what we do with them:

<List>
  <Word sl="open" m="to begin, to open, to turn on" />
  <Word sl="pini" m="to end, to close, to turn off" />
  <Word sl="jo" m="to hold, to contain, to include" />
</List>
