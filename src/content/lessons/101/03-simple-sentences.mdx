## Simple sentences

Now that you know how to read Toki Pona, it's time to learn words and sentences!  
Here are some words for things and actions:

| 󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina | Meaning                                            |
|-------------:|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 󱥢            | soweli         | land animal, like a cat, dog, cow, mouse, elephant |
| 󱥴            | waso           | bird, like a pigeon, goose, owl                    |
| 󱥑            | pipi           | insect, like a beetle, ant, butterfly, spider      |
| 󱤗            | kasi           | plant, like a clover, birch tree, cactus, moss     |
| 󱤶            | moku           | to consume                                         |
| 󱤮            | lukin          | to see                                             |
| 󱥡            | sona           | to know                                            |

A very common kind of sentence is called a "subject-verb-object" sentence, because, which have one thing (the subject) doing something to another thing (the object). Let's make a few sentences:

| 󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina          | Meaning                    |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 󱥢󱤧󱤶󱤉󱤗        | soweli li moku e kasi.  | The animal eats plants.    |
| 󱥴󱤧󱤶󱤉󱥑        | waso li moku e pipi.    | The bird eats bugs.        |
| 󱥑󱤧󱤮󱤉󱥢        | pipi li lukin e soweli. | The insect sees an animal. |
| 󱥴󱤧󱥡󱤉󱤗        | waso li sona e kasi.    | The bird knows the tree.   |

Here's what we can learn:

* The word order is the same as in English: subject, verb, object.
* **󱤧 li** is a particle that starts the verb.
* **󱤉 e** is a particle that starts the object.
* The English translation includes words and word-pieces like "the", "an", "-s", but those are guesses! The Toki Pona sentence doesn't specify if we're talking about "*a* bird" or "*the* bird". In longer conversations, it becomes pretty clear!

(**󱤧 li** and **󱤉 e** may seem unnecessary at first. We will learn about why they are required, but to do that, we first need to learn more about parts of speech!)

## Practice!
Fill in the blanks:

    hide="m"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="pipi li moku e kasi."
    m="The bug eats plants."
    hide="sl"
