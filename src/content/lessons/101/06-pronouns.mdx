## Pronouns

You're probably tired of long sentences and parts-of-speech shenanigans. Let's take it down a notch, by pointing at things:

<Sentences>
  <Sentence
    sl="ni"
    m="this, that"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="ni li soweli."
    m="This is an animal."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="ni li kasi."
    m="This is a plant."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="ni li moku pona."
    m="This is good food."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="ni li suli."
    m="This is important."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="ni li pona wawa."
    m="This is amazingly good."
  />
</Sentences>

These are our first _sentences without an object_, and so there is no **e** in these sentences!

(You might wonder, shouldn't "an animal, a plant, important" and so on, be the object? And it makes sense in English! You see a noun, verb, noun. But in many languages, including Toki Pona, "to be" doesn't exist as its own word. Instead, **li** introduces a verb "to-be-blank". This can be **soweli** "to be an animal", **suli** "to be important" and so on.)

Now that we've looked at one pronoun, let's get some more:

|  󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina | Meaning                                 |
| --: | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
|   󱤴 | mi             | I, we; my, our                          |
|   󱥞 | sina           | you; your                               |
|   󱥆 | ona            | she, he, it, they; her, his, its, their |

Let's practice using **󱤴 mi**, **󱥞 sina**, **󱥆 ona**, and **󱥁 ni** in sentences:

<Sentences>
  <Sentence
    sl="kasi ni li suli."
    m="This plant is big."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="sona sina li wawa."
    m="Your knowledge is amazing."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="pipi ni li pipi mi."
    m="This bug is my bug."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="waso sina li lukin e mi."
    m="Your bird sees me."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="waso li moku e pipi ni."
    m="The bird eats this bug."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="soweli mi li moku e kasi ona."
    m="My animal eats its plant."
  />
</Sentences>

They act like normal! But something strange happens when **󱤴 mi** or **󱥞 sina** is the subject of the sentence:

<Sentences>
  <Sentence
    sl="mi wawa."
    m="I am strong."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="sina lukin e moku."
    m="You see food."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="mi sona e kasi suli."
    m="I know the big plant."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="sina sona e suli kasi."
    m="You know the plant's size."
  />
</Sentences>

Toki Pona has a special rule: when **󱤴 mi** or **󱥞 sina** is the subject of the sentence, the **󱤧 li** that would normally follow them disappears. This is because sentences starting with **󱤴 mi** or **󱥞 sina** are extremely common!
