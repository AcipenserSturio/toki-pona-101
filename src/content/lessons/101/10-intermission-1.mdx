Nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, preverbs -- you have learned a lot by now! Let's slow down. As you know, language learning often focuses on drilling sentence after sentence. But getting good isn't just about repetitive bits of practice. It's also about listening, and reading, and talking to people.

For this lesson, let's read a short story in Toki Pona! It only uses the words and grammar we've learned so far.

Listen to an audio recording, and follow along in the text. After you're done listening, try to read the text aloud. See if you can follow the meaning of the text!

Once you're done practicing reading and listening, you can check the translation!

<summary>Translation</summary>

There was a deer in the forest.  
Her name was Mumu.  
Mumu was fast asleep.  
Trees protected her sleep.  

There came a strange loud noise.  
The deer woke up.  
She wanted to find out more about the noise.

There came a little sparrow.  
His name was Siju.  
The deer looked at the sparrow.  
She learned this:  
the noise came from this bird.

The sparrow was hungry.  
His food was gone.  
He was desperate.  
And so he cried out.

This saddened Mumu.  
The deer wanted to help the sparrow.  
She fed him a large caterpillar.

The sparrow ate the bug.  
This satisfied his hunger.

You may notice the translation isn't quite as literal as the example sentences! This is common. Once you have a story that spans several sentences, they start to help each other along.

Did any Toki Pona sentences or translations give you pause? Perhaps you still don't fully understand them? Good! That, too, is part of learning. This is where the community comes along.
