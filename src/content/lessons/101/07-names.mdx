## Names

Pointing at things is nice, but sometimes it's nice to be more specific. Introducing: names! A revolutionary technology that allows you to talk about someone or something in particular.

Let's learn the words for some things that often have names:

<List>
  <Word sl="jan" m="person"></Word>
  <Word sl="sitelen" m="image, writing; to draw, to write"></Word>
  <Word sl="toki" m="speech, language; to talk, to speak"></Word>
  <Word sl="ma" m="land, country"></Word>
</List>

You already know one name: _sitelen Lasina_! Let's look at a few more names:

<List>
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Nowa"
    m="person named Noah (from English 'Noah')"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Ema"
    m="person named Emma (from English 'Emma')"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="toki Kanse"
    m="language named French (from French 'français')"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="ma Tosi"
    m="land named German (from German 'Deutsch')"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="sitelen Lasina"
    m="writing named Latin (from Latin 'Latīna')"
  />
</List>

Here's what we can learn from these examples:

- Names behave exactly like modifiers: they come after another word.
- Names in Toki Pona are capitalised. They're the only kind of word that is capitalised! This distinguishes them from "regular" Toki Pona words.
- Names are often not from English. We like to use _endonyms_: self-names of countries, languages, people, and so on. The name for French comes from French!
- When names enter Toki Pona, they _change_ to the sound system of Toki Pona. There is no **d** in Toki Pona, so the word Deutsch starts with a **t**. The change is sometimes small, like _Noah_ ~ _Nowa_, sometimes large, like _français_ ~ _Kanse_.
- In _sitelen pona_, names are written using blocks, and each sound in the name is spelled out one by one, using words that start with that sound. We call these blocks _cartouches_, like the Egyptian ones.

Let's practice using the new words and names in sentences:

<List>
  <Sentence
    sl="jan li toki."
    m="People speak."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan pona li toki pona."
    m="Pleasant people speak well."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="waso li lukin e ma."
    m="The bird looks at the land."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Sunita li sitelen e pipi."
    m="Sunita draws a bug."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Nina li toki Kanse."
    m="Nina speaks French."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan Ema li sona pona e ma Tosi."
    m="Ema knows Germany well."
  />
</List>
