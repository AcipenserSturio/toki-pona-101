## Names

Pointing at things is nice, but sometimes it's nice to be more specific. Introducing: names! A revolutionary technology that allows you to talk about someone or something in particular.

Let's learn the words for some things that often have names:

| 󱥠󱥔 | sitelen Lasina | Meaning                             |
|-------------:|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 󱤑            | jan            | person                              |
| 󱥠            | sitelen        | image, writing; to draw, to write   |
| 󱥬            | toki           | speech, language; to talk, to speak |
| 󱤰            | ma             | land, country                       |

You already know one name: *sitelen Lasina*! Let's look at a few more names:

| Toki Pona | Meaning               | Where the name comes from |
|:------------:|----------------|-----------------------|
| 󱤑󱦐󱥁󱥆󱥴󱤈󱦑<br />jan Nowa       | person named Noah     | English 'Noah'            |
| 󱤑󱦐󱤉󱤴󱤈󱦑<br />jan Ema        | person named Emma     | English 'Emma'            |
| 󱥬󱦐󱤗󱤈󱥁󱥞󱤉󱦑<br />toki Kanse     | language named French | French 'français'         |
| 󱤰󱦐󱥬󱥆󱥞󱤍󱦑<br />ma Tosi        | land named Germany    | German 'Deutsch'          |
| 󱥠󱦐󱤧󱤈󱥞󱤍󱥁󱤈󱦑<br />sitelen Lasina | writing named Latin   | Latin 'Latīna'            |

Here's what we can learn from these examples:

* Names behave exactly like modifiers: they come after another word.
* Names in Toki Pona are capitalised. They're the only kind of word that is capitalised! This distinguishes them from "regular" Toki Pona words.
* Names are often not from English. We like to use *endonyms*: self-names of countries, languages, people, and so on. The name for French comes from French!
* When names enter Toki Pona, they *change* to the sound system of Toki Pona. There is no **d** in Toki Pona, so the word Deutsch starts with a **t**. The change is sometimes small, like *Noah* ~ *Nowa*, sometimes large, like *français* ~ *Kanse*.
* In *sitelen pona*, names are written using blocks, and each sound in the name is spelled out one by one, using words that start with that sound. We call these blocks *cartouches*, like the Egyptian ones.

Let's practice using the new words and names in sentences:

| 󱥠󱥔                    | sitelen Lasina                      | Meaning                     |

| 󱤑󱦐󱤗󱤉󱥁󱥬󱤈󱦑<br />󱤧󱥠󱤉󱥑          | jan Kenta li sitelen e pipi.        | Kenta draws a bug.          |
