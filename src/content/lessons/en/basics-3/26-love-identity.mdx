You've already seen that **󱤧󱥔󱥩󱤴 ... li pona tawa mi** is a common way to say '*i like ...*'. And, of course, we can say **󱥔󱤼 pona mute** to talk about *really liking* someone. But that's not the same as *loving* someone! So let's look at words for love, and what to call people you love:

<List>
  <Word sl="olin" m="to love" />
  <Word sl="unpa" m="to have sex" />
  <Word sl="mama" m="parent" />
  <Word sl="mije" m="man, masculine person, husband; male" />
  <Word sl="meli" m="woman, feminine person, wife; female" />
  <Word sl="tonsi" m="non-binary, gender-nonconforming; trans" />
</List>

Many language courses start with words for "man, woman, girl, boy, mother, father" and so on. In Toki Pona, gender is not so important. You won't see **󱤵 mije**, **󱤳 meli**, **󱥾 tonsi** in every sentence. They mostly come up when talking about social expectations about gender, and relationships in particular.

<List>
    <Sentence sl="mi olin e mije mi." m="I love my boyfriend."/>
    <Sentence sl="mama o!" m="Mom! (or) Dad!"/>
    <Sentence sl="mi olin e meli." m="I'm into girls."/>
</List>

**󱥾 tonsi** mostly means *non-binary*, but when used as an adjective it can talk about transness more broadly:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="ona li tonsi." m="They are non-binary." />
  <Sentence sl="mi tonsi e sijelo mi kepeken misikeke." m="I medically transition." />
</List>

## multiple subjects

We've already seen how *'e ... e ...'* can be used to introduce several objects to the sentence. You simply repeat the object. But you can't just repeat a subject, because then you wouldn't know where one subject ends and another begins! To solve this problem, we have another particle:

<List>
  <Word sl="en" m="joins subjects" />
  <Sentence sl="mi en ona li toki." m="Me and her are chatting." />
  <Sentence sl="soweli en waso li utala." m="The animal and the bird are fighting." />
  <Sentence sl="meli en mije li unpa." m="The woman and the man have sex." />
</List>
