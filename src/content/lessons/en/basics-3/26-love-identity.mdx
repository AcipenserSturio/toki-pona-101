You've already seen that **󱤧󱥔󱥩󱤴 ... li pona tawa mi** is a common way to say '*i like ...*'. And, of course, we can say **󱥔󱤼 pona mute** to talk about *really liking* someone. But that's not the same as *loving* someone! So let's look at words for love, and what to call people you love:

<List>
  <Word sl="olin" m="to love" />
  <Word sl="unpa" m="to have sex" />
  <Word sl="mama" m="parent" />
  <Word sl="mije" m="man, masculine person, husband; male" />
  <Word sl="meli" m="woman, feminine person, wife; female" />
  <Word sl="tonsi" m="non-binary, gender-nonconforming; trans" />
</List>

Many language courses start with words for "man, woman, girl, boy, mother, father" and so on. In Toki Pona, gender is not so important. You won't see **󱤵 mije**, **󱤳 meli**, **󱥾 tonsi** in every sentence. They mostly come up when talking about social expectations about gender, and relationships in particular.

<List>
    <Sentence sl="mi olin e mije mi." m="I love my boyfriend."/>
    <Sentence sl="mama o!" m="Mom! (or) Dad!"/>
    <Sentence sl="mi olin e meli." m="I'm into girls."/>
</List>

**󱥾 tonsi** mostly means *non-binary*, but when used as an adjective it can talk about transness more broadly:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="ona li tonsi." m="They are non-binary." />
  <Sentence sl="mi tonsi e sijelo mi kepeken misikeke." m="I medically transition." />
</List>

## multiple subjects

We've already seen how *'e ... e ...'* can be used to introduce several objects to the sentence, and how *'li ... li ...'* can be used to introduce several verbs. But we can't just put two subjects next to each other, because you wouldn't know where one subject ends and another begins. To solve this problem, we use a new particle in between:

<List>
  <Word sl="en" m="joins subjects" />
  <Sentence sl="mi en ona li toki." m="Me and her are chatting." />
  <Sentence sl="soweli en waso li utala." m="The animal and the bird are fighting." />
  <Sentence sl="meli en mije li unpa." m="The woman and the man have sex." />
</List>
