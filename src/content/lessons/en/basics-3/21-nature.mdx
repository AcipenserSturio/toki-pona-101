We already know most of the words for animal and plant stuff -- let's learn the remaining ones!

<List>
  <Word sl="akesi" m="reptile or amphibian, like a frog, lizard, snake" />
  <Word
    sl="kala"
    m="fish or sea creature, like a salmon, whale, shark, octopus"
  />
  <Word sl="pan" m="starchy food, like wheat, rice, bread, pasta" />
  <Word sl="kili" m="fruit, vegetable" />
  <Word sl="soko" m="mushroom" />
  <Word sl="misikeke" m="medicine" />
  <Word sl="namako" m="spice, garnish, adornment" />
  <Sentence sl="soko li kili nasa." m="Mushrooms are strange fruit." />
  <Sentence
    sl="kala suli li alasa e kala lili."
    m="A large fish hunts smaller fish."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="mi o moku e misikeke lon tenpo mute."
    m="I have to frequently take medication."
  />
</List>

## Ingredients

Bread products are often used to hold together several different ingredients:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="pan li jo e soweli." m="The pizza contains meat." />
  <Sentence sl="pan li jo e kili." m="The pizza contains vegetables." />
  <Sentence sl="pan li jo e namako." m="The pizza contains condiments." />
</List>

But how do we put them together into a single sentence? We just repeat the object of a sentence several times:

<List>
  <Sentence
  sl="pan li jo e soweli e kili e namako."
  m="The pizza contains meat, vegetables, (and) condiments."
/>
</List>
