Let's talk colours!

<List>
  <Word sl="kule" m="colour, kind" />
  <Word sl="walo" m="white, pale" />
  <Word sl="pimeja" m="black, dark" />
  <Word sl="loje" m="red, purple" />
  <Word sl="jelo" m="yellow" />
  <Word sl="laso" m="green, teal, blue" />
  <Word sl="taso" m="only, but" />
</List>

Like genders, Toki Pona colours are used less frequently than you might expect. In natural languages, colours often serve as easy shortcuts to mean something much more specific: *a white lie*, *the black market*, *a greenhouse*. Toki Pona doesn't like shortcuts that don't get to the point:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="tomo laso" m="a green house" />
  <Sentence sl="tomo kasi" m="a greenhouse" />
</List>

There's a big difference between a white house and the White House:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="tomo walo" m="a white house" />
  <Sentence sl="tomo ni: jan lawa pi ma Mewika li lon ona." m="the White House" />
</List>

I only bring it up now, because colours are the most obvious example, but the same actually applies to any phrase! Before using adjectives, it's often useful to stop and think: are these adjectives getting the important part you wanted to talk about, or are they just shorthand for something else?
