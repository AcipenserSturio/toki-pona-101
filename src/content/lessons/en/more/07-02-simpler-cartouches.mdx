_sitelen pona_ names can be quite long:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="lipu Wikipesija" m="Wikipedia" />
  <Sentence sl="ma Antasika" m="Antarctica" />
  <Sentence sl="ma Kolonpija" m="Colombia" />
</List>

People have come up with three notable systems to make names easier to read and write.

## 1. dots system: Û±§øÛ±•†Û±§ï

The dots system, or _nasin sitelen kalama_, was created by jan Pumiko in 2022, and has gained much popularity since then. In _nasin sitelen kalama_, you split up a word into _morae_: chunks that are like a syllable, but smaller. One mora is either consonant+vowel, or the -n after a vowel:

- to-ki
- ja-n
- a-n-pa
- si-n-pi-n

By adding middle-dots after a character, you increase how many morae should be pronounced in the name:

<List>
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±§ÖÛ±¶ë" sl="A" />
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±§ÖÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="An" />
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±§ÖÛ±¶úÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="Anpa" />
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±•üÛ±¶ë" sl="S" />
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±•üÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="Si" />
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±•üÛ±¶úÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="Sin" />
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±•üÛ±¶úÛ±¶úÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="Sinpi" />
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±•üÛ±¶úÛ±¶úÛ±¶úÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="Sinpin" />
</List>

(You might notice a funny quirk of this system: **Û±¶êÛ±§ÖÛ±¶ë** makes up a full mora, so adding a dot adds the next mora, which is **-n**. But **Û±¶êÛ±•üÛ±¶ë** is not a full mora, so adding a dot only completes the first mora, which is **si**.)

You can also use a colon to mean the entire word should be pronounced:

<List>
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±§ÖÛ±¶ùÛ±¶ë" sl="Anpa" />
  <Word sp="Û±¶êÛ±•üÛ±¶ùÛ±¶ë" sl="Sinpin" />
</List>

Put several characters together in a cartouche, and you can write a name:

<List>
  <Sentence sp="Û±§∞Û±¶êÛ±•°Û±¶úÛ±§øÛ±§úÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="ma Sonko" />
  <Sentence sp="Û±§∞Û±¶êÛ±§ÖÛ±¶úÛ±•©Û±¶úÛ±•úÛ±¶úÛ±§îÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="ma Antasika" />
  <Sentence sp="Û±§∞Û±¶êÛ±§úÛ±¶ùÛ±§¨Û±¶ùÛ±•çÛ±¶ùÛ±§ëÛ±¶úÛ±¶ë" sl="ma Kolonpija" />
</List>

* üéâ you use fewer word characters to write one name!
* üôÅ the cartouche is still quite long.

## 2. tally system: Û±§øÛ±•†Û±§ïÛ±•çÛ±§©Û±§®

The tally system was created by jan Sonja in 2024. In it, every character in the cartouche gets a tally mark below. You add one tally mark for every additional sound you want to pronounce:

{/* Note: this section uses non-standard codepoints F19FC-F19FF, which I modded into nasin nanpa. If you ever update nasin nanpa, this section will break. Ideally, nskpll gets standardised later. */}

<List>
  <Sentence sp="Û±§∞Û±¶êÛ±•°&#xF19FE;Û±§ú&#xF19FD;Û±¶ë" sl="ma Sonko" />
  <Sentence sp="Û±§∞Û±¶êÛ±§Ö&#xF19FD;Û±•©&#xF19FD;Û±•ú&#xF19FD;Û±§î&#xF19FD;Û±¶ë" sl="ma Antasika" />
  <Sentence sp="Û±§∞Û±¶êÛ±§ú&#xF19FD;Û±§¨&#xF19FE;Û±•ç&#xF19FD;Û±§ë&#xF19FD;Û±¶ë" sl="ma Kolonpija" />
</List>

## 3. abbreviations

This method was tried by jan Sonja in *lipu su*: "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Toki Pona edition)". At first, you introduce a person, language, or place with its full name:

<List>
  <Sentence sp="Û±§ëÛ±¶êÛ±•≠Û±•ÖÛ±•∑Û±§ÉÛ±•¶Û±§åÛ±¶ë" sl="jan Towasi" m="Dorothy" />
</List>

But in following sentences, you abbreviate the name to just the first character:

<List>
  <Sentence sp="Û±§ëÛ±¶êÛ±•≠Û±¶ë" sl="jan T." m="Dorothy" />
</List>
