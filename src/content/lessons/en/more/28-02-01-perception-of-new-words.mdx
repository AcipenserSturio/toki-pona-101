## different perspectives

In 2001-2017, Toki Pona was mostly seen through the lens of *authorial intent*. The way jan Sonja speaks was seen as *canonical*, and if other people speak differently, it's a bit like a *fan interpretation*. You see occasional proposals for new words from the community, but they never gain traction.

In 2017-2020, a Discord community of speakers starts growing, and people begin to experiment -- both with words from older drafts by jan Sonja, like **󱥽 monsuta**, and with entirely new words, like **󱥾 tonsi**. This reached a peak in 2020-2022, where new word proposals were seen almost every week. Toki Pona was seen as a *language to experiment with*.

From 2022 onwards, community attention slowly moved on from coining new words. Toki Pona was increasingly seen as a *living language*, where common patterns of speech have already formed and settled. Newcomers are recommended to focus on learning how people already speak of complicated ideas, instead of coming up with new, incompatible solutions.

## kijetesantakalu

<List>
  <Word sl="kijetesantakalu" m="raccoon; raccoon-like animal, like a cacomistle, red panda, kinkajou (75%)" />
</List>

jan Sonja coined **󱦀 kijetesantakalu** on April Fools 2009. **󱦀 kijetesantakalu** is long and very specific, which contrasts nicely how genuine Toki Pona words are shorter and more broad.

For a long time, it was just a joke in passing. The *experimentation* wave of 2017-2020 brought it back, gave it a glyph, and through that, made it a beloved mascot.

Today, despite it originally being a joke, it appears in the *living language* almost like a normal word.

## yupekosi

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="yupekosi" m="to behave like George Lucas and revise your old creative works and actually make them worse (13%)" />
</List>

**yupekosi** was created by jan Sonja in 2019, in a then-rare visit to [ma pona](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x). It subverts the idea of *authorial intent*: look, the creator can still make something that doesn't suit the language! The joke is similar to **kijetesantakalu**: it's long and hyper-specific.

## Pingo

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="Pingo" m="car (0-5%)" />
</List>

In **yupekosi**, jan Sonja accidentally used **y** for **j**, which spawned a new genre of joke words: breaking orthographic and phonetic convention. **Pingo** appears almost tame compared to **kijetesantakalu**: it's short, and could easily become broad in meaning. But no, that's still a joke! It's capitalised for no reason, and it uses **g** for no reason.

People kept one-upping their "new rule-breaking words", such as 'poak23087[i23ej&(^$!(*#!@&$*_(HEQq0j' by kili pan Juli, also meaning 'car'.

## alente

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="alente" m="the set of concepts expressed by established toki pona words, subtracted from the set of every possible concept, such that every concept not already expressed by an existing toki pona word is expressed (0-5%)" />
</List>

Translating the overly-mathsy 'definition': **alente** is trying to say that no matter what new word you create, **alente** already includes its meaning. It represents a reaction to *too much experimentation and absurdity*. And indeed, by the time it was created in 2022, most of the interesting ideas for new words had been sufficiently explored. Usage was stabilising, and the community slowly moved towards the *living language* concept.

## conclusion?

Sorry if this felt more like a weird rant than an explanation! Wrapping up:

Toki Pona has a complicated relationship with creating new words:
* Due to respect for *authorial intent*, almost all words we use originally came from jan Sonja, with very few exceptions like **󱥾 tonsi**, **󱦆 n**, **󱦁 soko**.
* Due to *experimentation*, we have a vast array of previously explored ideas, which someone tried turning into a word.
* Due to slowly becoming a *living language*, most of the newer ideas are very unlikely to affect people's speech, as they try to solve problems that already have solutions, or don't need solutions.
