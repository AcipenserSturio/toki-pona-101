This course teaches **131 words**. These words are used by *at least 60%* of Toki Pona speakers. **120** of them were used in **󱤪󱥕 lipu pu** -- *'Toki Pona: The Language of Good'* by jan Sonja, which came out in 2014. A few more words became common in community speech. You can think of these words as *core* or *common* vocabulary, which lets you talk about anything.

Below is a list of words that are *less commonly used*, but still in use by at least 5% of Toki Pona speakers. They exist for several reasons:

* Some of them were created early on, for early drafts of Toki Pona. They are redundant in today's speech, but some people are interested in this kind of "digital archaeology"!
* Some of them are attempts to fill seeming 'gaps' in the language, to make it function better. Let's discuss why these attempts didn't sway most proficient speakers!
* Some of them are in-jokes. Let's explain their history!

## ali

<List>
  <Word sp="󱤄" sl="ali" m="all, every, 100" />
</List>

**󱤄 ali** is an alternate pronunciation and spelling of **󱤄 ale**. The meaning is the same. It was created early on, because some early Toki Pona speakers were uncomfortable with **󱤄 ale** being so similar to **󱤂 ala**.

Between 2001 and 2017, both pronunciations were about equally frequent. But Toki Pona rapidly increased in popularity since 2020, and **󱤄 ale** overtook **󱤄 ali**, and is now used more than 10 times as much!

## apeja

<List>
  <Word sl="apeja" m="shame, embarrassment, dishonor" />
</List>

**󱦡 apeja** was made as 'an experimental idea in a forum post' in 2009. In 2016-2020, it was one of the more popular words on this list, and was one of the first words to receive a *sitelen pona* glyph by the community. Since 2021, it slowly faded to obscurity.

It has got a nice sound and an angsty meaning, so it's frequently appeared in songs, like jan Lija's [apeja li mi](https://janusawi.bandcamp.com/track/akesi-apeja-li-mi) (cover by [jan Usawi](https://www.youtube.com/@janusawi8794)) or [o lape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1_Uys7SNlg) by [kala pona Tonyu](https://www.youtube.com/@kalapona).

In casual conversation, **pilin anpa** adequately describes apeja.

## interjections

<List>
  <Word sl="epiku" m="epic, awesome, amazing" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="kulijo" m="cool, fine" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="oke" m="okay" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="wa" m="wow" />
</List>

These words were created in 2017-2020. They're all interjections, although you'll sometimes see one in a full sentence. They all either come straight from English, or share a related interjection in English.

We saw them quite a bit in 2020-2022. As more people became proficient, they began to play around more with *common words* in these roles instead. Interjections like **󱥵 wawa!** [moved in](https://ilo.muni.la/?query=wa+-+wa_2%2C+wawa+-+wawa_2&minSentLen=1&scale=rel&field=hits&start=1470009600&end=1722470400&smoothing=2&smoother=gauss) to fill this role. You can see more examples in [lesson 18](https://wasona.com/en/18/#interjections).

**kulijo** has made an appearance in jan Usawi's [likujo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSvCudF5A0).

## isipin

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="isipin" m="to think" />
</List>

**isipin** was created in 2020. Usually people start using it because they don't know how to say 'to think'. Toki Pona has several ways to talk about thoughts. You can use different ones, depending on your intentions:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi toki insa e pilin mi." m="I'm pondering my feelings. (= talking internally)" />
  <Sentence sp="󱤴󱥎󱤉󱥁" sl="mi pilin e ni: ..." m="I think that... (= believe, feel)" />
  <Sentence sl="mi sitelen insa e ma." m="I imagine a landscape. (= draw internally)" />
</List>

## jami

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="jami" m="yummy" />
</List>

**jami** was created several times in 2017-2020, perhaps to mirror **jaki**. It was mildly popular in 2020, and made a bit of a resurgence in 2024.

It is essentially just **󱥦 suwi**. Both words can refer to food specifically, or to feelings in general.

## jasima

<List>
  <Word sl="jasima" m="mirror, to mirror" />
</List>

**jasima** was created in 2018. It was probably created to fill some 'gap' for the meaning of 'opposite'. Toki Pona has a preposition **sama** 'same as', but no dedicated preposition meaning 'opposite to'.

This meaning was very confusing, and so in practice, the word has slowly morphed into something about mirrors. Of course, Toki Pona has many ways to talk about opposition, reflection, and mirrors:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi lukin e mi lon sinpin." m="I look at myself in the mirror." />
  <Sentence sl="ilo lukin li pana e sitelen ante." m="The mirror gives off an inversed image." />
  <Sentence sl="sinpin pi tomo mi li lukin e sinpin pi tomo sina." m="My building faces yours. My building is opposite yours." />
</List>

## noises

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="jonke" m="hjönk, goose noise" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="nja" m="nya, cat noise" />
</List>

These words were created in 2021. Naturally, people bring them up mostly for humour. **jonke** is inspired by Untitled Goose Game. **nja** is not a valid sequence of sounds in Toki Pona, but it pokes fun at **󱦆 n**, which is in a similar predicament. Some people still like **nja**, because we love cats. I've not see a **jonke** in years.

## personal portmanteaus

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="kamalawala" m="anarchy" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="wasoweli" m="both-bird-and-mammal-like creature" />
</List>

These two words are interesting because they share pretty much the same creation story. They are shortenings or portmanteaus of existing Toki Pona words, created within a specific story -- jan Wesu's [jan pi kamalawala](https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/340307145373253642/721262364187426836) and akesi kon Nalasuni's [Caves of Qud mod](https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/301378960468738050/690041651397132345). Outside these stories, of course, you can just describe them with a sentence or two.

**kamalawala** occasionally crops up in political conversations, because people enjoy discussing anarchism, and [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rux982I-MA), because it is fun to say.

## colour words

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="kapesi" m="brown, grey" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="unu" m="purple" />
</List>

Toki Pona has five colour words: **󱥲 walo**, **󱥏 pimeja**, **󱤫 loje**, **󱤒 jelo**, **󱤣 laso**. Two other ones, **kapesi** and **unu**, gained popularity in 2021, but slowly declined back to obscurity since then.

Using common words, you can achieve specific hues and shades like brown or purple by mixing colour words together (**loje laso**, **jelo pimeja**, or other combinations). Often, you don't even need that level of specificity, and just one colour word will be a sufficient description. You can also talk about the colour associated to a real object, like **kule ma**.

Past courses usually taught **󱤫 loje** as 'red, reddish', but a [colour poll](https://antetokipona.infinityfreeapp.com/kule/kule.php?lang=tok&i=1) we ran in 2024 showed that magenta is also a core of what counts as **󱤫 loje**. The decline of **unu** could be related to this.

**kapesi** has appeared in a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArGaIGXJCZE) by kala pona Tonyu.
