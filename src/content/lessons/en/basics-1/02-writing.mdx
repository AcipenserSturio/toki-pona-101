## Two writing systems

You've already seen how Toki Pona uses the Latin alphabet, which we call _sitelen Lasina_. But many of us also use our own unique script called _sitelen pona_, meaning _good writing_. It is a logography: every word in Toki Pona gets its own little character. It's a lot of fun to use, and also helps you memorise words!

Let's take a look at a short poem and compare _sitelen Lasina_ and _sitelen pona_:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>󱥠󱥔 sitelen pona</th>
      <th>sitelen Lasina</th>
      <th>Translation</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>󱥞󱥅󱤉󱥱<br />󱥨󱥞󱥡󱤂<br />󱥱󱤧󱤍󱤉󱥞</td>
      <td>sina olin e utala.<br />taso sina sona ala:<br />utala li ike e sina.</td>
      <td>You love conflict.<br />But you don’t understand<br />that conflict makes you worse.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Pronounce the poem aloud, then listen to the audio!

Here are some things to notice here:

- Sentences in _sitelen Lasina_ start with lowercase letters, unlike English!
- _sitelen Lasina_ uses punctuation like English, but _sitelen pona_ doesn't.
- 󱥠󱥔 _sitelen pona_ is very intuitive! The glyph for "love" is hearts. The glyph for "conflict" is swords. The glyph for "make worse" is a frown.
