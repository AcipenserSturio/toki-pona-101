# toki pona 101: a crash course into Toki Pona

Welcome! This course is not finished. If you're here by accident, please do not read it. Take a look at some good, finished courses instead:
* [lipu sona pona](https://lipu-sona.pona.la/) by jan Lentan
* [lipu sona](https://lipu-sona.comforttiger.space/en) by soweli Lote
* [Learn Toki Pona!](https://mun.la/sona/) by mun Kekan San
* and of course, [lipu pu](https://tokipona.org/) by jan Sonja

I'm writing this one for fun and it needs work. Let's see where this goes!
